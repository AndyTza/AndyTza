### Hi there 👋


My name is Anastasios Tzanidakis. I'm a third-year astrophysics Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. 


Beyond my academic pursuits, I’m deeply passionate about promoting equitable science communication, particularly inspiring youth to pursue STEM careers. Currently serving as the director of the University of Washington’s planetarium, I’m committed to educating, inspiring, and mentoring the next generation of astronomers and science educators. I run a social media account called [@AndTzaAstro](instagram.com/andytzaastro), dedicated to promoting open-source tools and blogs about astronomy and astrophysics.
